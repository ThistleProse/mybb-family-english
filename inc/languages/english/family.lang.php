If you want to start with your character's parents, that's Generation 1, and you yourself are Generation 2. If you start with the grandparents, then they are Generation 1, your parents are Generation 2, and you are Generation 3! Consider in advance which family generation your own character belongs to—perhaps they have children, nieces and nephews, or even grandchildren? Is your own character perhaps even Generation 1? You can really let your imagination run wild here and create as many generations as are important for your character. For your character's position in the family, it's best to always start with Generation 1! If Generation 1 is a mother, then Generation 2 could be a daughter or son, Generation 3 a grandson – and so on. You can specify further information in the short description.";
